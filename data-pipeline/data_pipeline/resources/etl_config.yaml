# These values can be overridden by environment variables:
# - ETL_FIRE_AND_FORGET
# - ETL_TASK_SPACING
# - ETL_TASK_JITTER
# - ETL_JOIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS

# If false, the producer waits for all tasks to complete.
fire_and_forget: true

# Base spacing in seconds between scheduled tasks to avoid hammering APIs
task_spacing: 0.1

# Maximum random jitter in seconds added to each task delay
# This helps prevent synchronized bursts from multiple workers
task_jitter: 0.05

# Timeout in seconds when waiting for all tasks to complete (when fire_and_forget is false)
