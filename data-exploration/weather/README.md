### Weather data comparison

Data from two weather providers (Visual Crossing and Open-Meteo) were preprocessed and compared.
In summary, Open-Meteo was found to be superior in providing two types of irradiance instead of a single 
quantity; offers data from several different weather models; and has a generous free tier pricing model.

Preprocessing of the weather data has since been updated and the corresponding notebook 
(`weather-data-comparison.ipynb`) deleted, but the relevant data version and notebook can still be found 
in Git history.
